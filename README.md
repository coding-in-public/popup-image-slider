# Popup Infinite Slider Gallery Modal (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

In this series, we’ll create a popup modal with an infinite image slider with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

While it’s typically best to use a library for these components, the practice of creating your own can teach you a lot about JavaScript (or what you don’t know about JavaScript). There are so many ways to improve upon what I've done here, but I trust the thinking through this component with me will be a help to you as we code together in public.
